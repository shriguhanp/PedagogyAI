# DecomposeAgent Prompt Configuration (English)

system:
  role: |
    You are a research planning expert, responsible for decomposing complex topics into logically clear, non-overlapping subtopic systems.

process:
  generate_queries: |
    Generate {num_queries} search queries for the following topic. Only output JSON object:

    Topic: {topic}

    Requirements:
    1. Each query 1-3 keywords, concise and representative
    2. Cover different dimensions of the topic to ensure diversity
    3. Avoid duplication between queries

    Output JSON:
    {{
        "queries": ["Query 1", "Query 2", ...]
    }}

  decompose: |
    Decompose the topic into subtopics based on the following information. Only output JSON object:

    Main Topic: {topic}

    Background Knowledge (from RAG retrieval):
    {rag_context}

    {decompose_requirement}

    **Decomposition Steps:**

    1. **Analyze Background Knowledge**: Identify core concepts, key theories, and important content

    2. **Identify Research Dimensions**: Determine research focus for each dimension, ensure dimensions are complementary

    3. **Generate Subtopics**:
       - Based on actual content in background knowledge
       - Subtopics are logically related but not duplicated
       - Cover main aspects of the theme

    4. **Refine Descriptions**:
       - title: Concise and clear, expressing the core of the subtopic
       - overview: 2-3 sentences, explaining content, importance, and research value

    Output JSON:
    {{
        "sub_topics": [
            {{
                "title": "Subtopic Title",
                "overview": "Detailed overview, explaining content, focus, and research value"
            }}
        ]
    }}

  decompose_without_rag: |
    Decompose the following research topic into clear, well-structured subtopics. Only output JSON object:

    Main Topic: {topic}

    {decompose_requirement}

    **Decomposition Steps (Without RAG Context):**

    1. **Identify Key Aspects**: Based on your knowledge, identify the key aspects and dimensions of this topic

    2. **Generate Subtopics**:
       - Each subtopic should cover a distinct aspect of the main topic
       - Subtopics should have logical relationships but not overlap or duplicate
       - Ensure subtopics together form a comprehensive research framework

    3. **Refine Descriptions**:
       - title: Concise and clear, expressing the core focus of the subtopic
       - overview: 2-3 sentences explaining:
         - What this subtopic covers
         - Why it's important for understanding the main topic
         - Key concepts or areas to explore

    Output JSON:
    {{
        "sub_topics": [
            {{
                "title": "Subtopic title (concise and clear)",
                "overview": "Detailed overview (2-3 sentences explaining importance, scope, and key areas)"
            }}
        ]
    }}
